There's not yet much sample code knocking around for iOS 7 custom transitions yet: I guess that NDA is still only freshly lifted.

This is a simple example of how to present a new `UIModalPresentationCustom`-type Modal UIViewController with a `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate` managing the show. Have a play with it, I hope it helps.
